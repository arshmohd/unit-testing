# Unit Testing - Guided example

  

<br>

  

## Iteration 1 - Initial Setup

  

**Fork** this repository first. After you have successfully forked the repository to your account **clone** it to your machine.

  
  
  

<!-- **Fork** this repository. You should see an "**Actions**" tab at the top of the GitHub interface for your fork. Click it. You should see the following:

Since our automated tests will be running not only locally but also on GitHub, we need to enable workflows for this repository. Click on "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them". You'll have to do this for every lab that has automated tests.

  

Clone the fork to your machine. -->

  

## Iteration 2 - Exploring the project

  

At the root of this project you'll find multiple files that are worthy of notice.

  

First, `package.json`. This files contains the external dependencies necessary to make the project work, as well as the configurations necessary to run our unit tests. Plus, it holds a set of custom scripts that we can run using the `npm run` command. You won't have to change the contents of this file.

  

Second, you will find a tests directory. This directory contains multiple files with the `.spec.js` extensions. It is common to name unit test files ending with a `.spec.js` or `.tests.js` extension.

  

Third, our main working file, `calculator.js`. It contains four distinct functions, one for each of the basic arithmetic operations. The functions `sum`, `subtract` and `divide` are incomplete. Later in the lab, you'll be asked to work on each to meet specific requirements. The fourth function, `multiply`, is implemented. You'll be asked to create unit tests to ensure that it runs as expected. At the bottom of this file you'll find an unfamiliar syntax (reading `module.exports = /* ... */`). It is required to make our unit tests work, and you'll be learning more about it later on.

  

Files such as `package-lock.json` (you don't see it just yet, but soon you will), and directories such as `.github` and `node_modules` (also, you don't see it just yet, but soon you will) are not relevant right now. By the end of this bootcamp, you will know much more about all these terms that probably don't make too much sense now. Patience :pray:

  

## Iteration 3 - Setting up the project

  

Open your terminal.

  

To run our unit tests on your machine, you must have both `Node.js` and `npm` installed. You can ensure you have both by running the following commands:

  

```shell

$ node -v

# and

$ npm -v

```

  

As a result, you should see the versions of either installed on your machine.

  

As stated, our `package.json` file holds a list of the dependencies for this project. However, these dependencies are not automatically fetched when you clone the repository into your machine. To fetch and install the project's dependencies, follow the instructions below:

  

```shell

# after you cloned this guided example, navigate inside the repo

$ cd unit-testing-guided-example

# and install project dependencies

$ npm i

```

  

After this point, you will see that a new file has been created (`package-lock.json`) as well as new folder (`node_modules`) but no changes will be made from your side inside there so no need to dig deeper into it for now.

  

## Iteration 4 - Running unit tests, seeing failures

  

Before working on any of the functionalities that we intend to unit test, let's run the `npm run test` command on our terminal.

  

```shell

# in the root of this project

$ npm run test

```

There should be two distinct forms of output. First, your terminal should display a list of the failed unit tests. Second, a file named **`lab-solution.html`** should be automatically generated at the root of the project. Opening this file will display the results of the unit tests in the browser.

  

:bangbang: If you get a message that reads "jest: command not found", you might have skipped the previous step where we installed dependencies using `npm install`.

Since we don't want to have to run these tests every time we make changes to our solution, we can start the test-runner in _"watch mode"_. That means that `jest` will be looking for changes in our code, and will re-run the automated tests every time you save a file. To run the test-runner in "watch mode", run the `npm run test:watch` command in your terminal.

  

```shell

$ npm run test:watch

```

  

To see the results of the unit tests being updated automatically in the browser window, you can use the VSCode extension ["Live Server"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to open the `lab-solution.html` file.

  

## Iteration 5 - Passing our first tests

  

To pass the first tests, open the `calculator.js` file and complete the `sum` function.

  

If you simply return a sum of both arguments from the `sum` function, you should see at least the first two tests of the "Sum" suite passing. However, a few other tests in the test suite are failing.

  

For this particular `sum` function, we don't expect it to simply sum any two values that it is passed. We want a few edge cases to be considered an properly handled.

  

- If the function is called with a single number, and no second argument is passed, the function should act as if the second argument passed equals `0`.

- If the function is called without any arguments, the function should act as if both arguments passed equal `0`.

  

## Iteration 6 - Subtracting

  

The `subtract` function follows the same logic. Complete it, and check the results of the unit tests to ensure that all of the requirements are met.

  

## Iteration 7 - Dividing

  

In maths, [we cannot divide a number by 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero). However, if you perform a division operation in JavaScript, the value returned is `Infinity`.

  

JavaScript takes a relaxed approach on this topic, but we don't want to allow our `divide` function to make this mistake. As such, if the user calls the function `divide` and passes a `0` as the second argument, you should "throw" an error with the message "Cannot divide by 0".

  

To throw an error in JavaScript, you should write:

  

```js

throw  new Error('An explanatory error message');

```

  

Our `divide` unit tests will experiment with dividing plain integers, floating point numbers, but also dividing by `0`. If this edge case is not considered, the last test of the test suite will fail.

  

## Bonus: Iteration 8 - Creating our own tests

  

Up until now, we've been coding our functions to pass our tests. What we've been unknowingly doing is following a testing methodology called **"Test-Driven Development"**. This happens when the tests have been written in advance, and we're simply completing our functions to match the specifications that had been originally defined.

  

Now, we'll work in reverse.

  

You can inspect and compare the other `*.spec.js` files to understand how _suites_, _tests_ and _assertions_ are made with Jest.

  

You're given a `multiply` function inside of the `calculate.js` file. It is already complete, and requires no work from you side.

  

However, there are no unit tests for this function as of yet.

  

Create a file named `multiply.spec.js`. In this file you'll create unit tests for the `multiply` function.

  

At the top of `multiply.spec.js`, you should import the `multiply` function that is exported by `calculator.js`. You can simply copy and paste the following line.

  

```js

const { multiply } = require('./../calculator.js');

```

  

Create a test suite for the "Multiply" functionality.

  

```js

describe('Multiply', () => {

// Our tests will be added here.

});

```

  

Then, inside of this test suite, we'll be writing each of the following tests that consider the following scenarios.

  

- Function is called with two positive integers. The value returned should be the result of the multiplication of both values.

- Function is called with a negative and a positive integer. The value returned should be a negative number.

- Function is called with any number and a number `0`. The value returned should be `0` (any number multiplied by `0` equals `0`).

  

It's up to you to decide what values the `multiply` function should be called with, and what values are expected as a result.

  

Follow the same naming pattern for tests that you find in the other test files. You can also consult [the `jest` documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect), although you shouldn't need to.

  

## Iteration 9 - Committing the solution

  

You have solved all of the prior iterations. All of the tests are passing locally.

  

Let's **commit** our work, and **push** it to GitHub.

 

Best of luck ðŸ’™
